This is a standalone version of Richard Stevens' "sock" program, based on the code available for the TCP/IP Illustrated Volume1 book, at:

The code was originally written for UNIX. 
I made some changes so that it can also be built on Linux.

I'm more than happy to incorporate build fixes where feasible and necessary.
